<h3>About</h3>

<p><strong>Training:</strong> We offer training and mentoring workshops throughout the day - <strong>no prior knowledge of code is necessary</strong>. And we mean none. Some examples of classes are: Intro to... Ruby, APIs, Python, GitHub, html/CSS, and SQL.</p>

<p><strong>Hackathon:</strong> This is a civic hackathon, and we usually work on projects from <a href="http://codefordc.org">Code for DC</a>, but you're welcome to bring anything and pitch it.</p>
