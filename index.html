<h3>What to expect at the event</h3>

<p><strong>Training:</strong> &nbsp;We offer training and mentoring workshops throughout the day - <strong>no prior knowledge of code is necessary</strong>. And we mean none. Some examples of classes are: Intro to... Ruby, APIs, Python, GitHub, html/CSS, and SQL.</p>

<p><strong>Hackathon:</strong> &nbsp;This is a civic hackathon, and we usually work on projects from <a href="http://codefordc.org">Code for DC</a>, but you're welcome to bring anything and pitch it.</p>
