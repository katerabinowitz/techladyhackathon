<h3>About the Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day</h3>

<p>Coders, tech strategists, trainers, newbies, and ideas are welcome! The goal of these hackathon + training days is for you to contribute to a project you find meaningful, learn new tech, make new friends and connections, and then attend more DC tech meetups/hackathons - especially <a href="http://codefordc.org">Code for DC</a>! We want you to walk away feeling inspired and empowered to get more involved in tech.</p>

<p>Over 100 women attended the December Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day. Read my blog post about it, including links to more info and coverage: <a href="http://leah.io/2014/01/that-techlady-hackathon-we-organized-was-awesome-so-whats-next/">That Tech Lady Hackathon We Organized Was Awesome, So What's Next??</a></p>

<p><strong>Training</strong><br/>
We offer basic 101 intro training and mentoring workshops throughout the day - <strong>no prior knowledge of code is necessary</strong>. And we mean none. Attend sessions all day or dip in and out while you contribute to a hackathon project.</p>
<p>Some examples of the 101 intro classes we offer are: Ruby, APIs, Python, GitHub, html/CSS, and SQL. Mentoring sessions we offered previously were: Empowerment/imposter syndrome, open gov/open data, and lady mentoring session. Ideas? Are we missing anything important?
