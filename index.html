<h3>About the Hackathon and Training</h3>

<p><strong>Training:</strong><br>We offer basic 101 intro training and mentoring workshops throughout the day - <strong>no prior knowledge of code is necessary</strong>. And we mean none.</p>

<p>Some examples of the 101 intro classes we offer are: Ruby, APIs, Python, GitHub, html/CSS, and SQL. Mentoring sessions we offered previously were: Empowerment/imposter syndrome, open gov/open data, and lady mentoring session.</p>

<p><strong>Hackathon:</strong><br>
This is a civic hackathon, and we usually work on projects from <a href="http://codefordc.org">Code for DC</a>, but you're welcome to bring anything.</p>
