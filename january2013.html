	<li><strong>Tuesday Jan. 7, 6-9pm: Code for DC meetup.</strong> IMPORTANT: if you are looking for training, I maintain that attending meetups like Code for DC is one of the best ways to learn. This is the DC chapter of the Code for America Brigade. We are a group of volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues and help people engage with the city. We welcome all tech skill levels. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/code-for-dc" target="_self">RSVP LINK</a></li>
