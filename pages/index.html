<p>Over 150 women attended the 2nd Tech Lady Hackathon in July 2014. Check out the summary: <a href="http://codefordc.org/blog/2014/07/28/techlady-hackathon-recap.html">The Second Tech Lady Hackathon was Tremendous</a>.</p>

<p>This year, we're expanding! We've got a sister Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day in Tucson, Arizona and we're hoping to add more locations soon. Stay tuned to see if Tech Lady is coming to a community near you!</p>

<h3>About the Hackathon and Training</h3>

<p><strong>Training:</strong> We offer basic 101 intro training and mentoring workshops throughout the day â€” <strong>no prior knowledge of code is necessary</strong>. And we mean none. Some examples of the 101 intro classes we offer are: Ruby, APIs, Python, GitHub, HTML/CSS, and SQL. Mentoring sessions we offered previously were: empowerment/imposter syndrome, open gov/open data, and lady mentoring sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Hackathon:</strong> This is a civic hackathon, and we usually work on projects from <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigades</a>, but you're welcome to bring anything and pitch it.</p>
